# 中文版说明

这个代码本来是做作业的，然后想着既然可能以后也有人会用到干脆就开源共享出来好了。

适用于软件RoboAnalyzer的Visual Robots部分。

代码本身需要使用Jupyter Notebook，VS Code这类支持Jupyter环境的编译程序运行。

# Description

This code was originally for homework, and then I thought that since someone might use it in the future I would just share it as open source.

It is applicable to the Visual Robots section of the desktop software RoboAnalyzer.

The code itself needs to be run with Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and other compiled programs that support the Jupyter environment.
